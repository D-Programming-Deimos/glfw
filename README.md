====

[GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/) is a free, Open Source, multi-platform library for opening a window, 
creating an OpenGL context and managing input. It is easy to integrate into existing applications and
does not lay claim to the main loop.
GLFW is written in C and has native support for Windows, Mac OS X and many Unix-like systems using the X Window System, 
such as Linux and FreeBSD. GLFW is licensed under the zlib/libpng license.
